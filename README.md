# CS253_HW10
Clusters PGM images into similar categories based on trained perceptions

NOTE: There are some fixes that still need to be made.  Namely, better 
comments and it leaks memory right now but I know for sure that the 
leak is in Array.h because it is litterally the only place I allocate my 
own memory.

Regardless, I did have the fastest PA10 so at least others can look at 
how I did that. :)
